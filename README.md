# Project Background
Based on the data found, the team has concluded that Users are unaware of the requirements for obtaining licenses, leading to a significant amount of time spent on licensing procedures. Additionally, the community faces difficulty in accessing legal assistance services tailored to their specific issues due to a lack of information about current laws. Users also express a desire to voice their legal concerns to experts.

**Proposed Solution**
Creating a platform to support users in accessing legal services, including services, consultations, information, and business legality, easily and quickly.
